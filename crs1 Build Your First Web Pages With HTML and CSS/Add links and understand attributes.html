<p>Although most polar bears are born on land, they spend most of their time on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sea_ice"> sea ice </a> . Their scientific name means <a href= "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marine_mammal">"maritime bear"</a> and derives from this fact. Polar bears hunt their preferred food of seals from the edge of sea ice, often living off fat reserves when no sea ice is present. Because of their dependence on the sea ice, polar bears are classified as marine mammals.</p>
